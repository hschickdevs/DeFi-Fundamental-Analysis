# DeFi-Fundamental-Analysis

 In this project for my UT Austin MSITM Financial Technology class I explore a few DeFi protocols, and then test the applicability of fundamental analysis in the DeFi lanscape.

 I will be testing and analyzing these platforms on the Base Ethereum L2 chain as it has cheaper gas fees and faster transaction times than the Ethereum L1 chain.

## 1. Uniswap - Price Impact & Swapping

> ðŸ”Ž _See my analysis notebook here for reference: [**Uniswap Analysis**](Uniswap_Analysis.ipynb)_

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap various ERC-20 tokens. It is a popular platform for trading and providing liquidity to the DeFi ecosystem.

One of the key considerations when swapping tokens is the price impact of your trade. The price impact of a trade is essentially the impact of your trade on the market of the underlying asset pair. When you trade one asset for another, you're increasing the supply of one asset and decreasing the supply of the other. This can cause the price of the asset you're buying to increase and the price of the asset you're selling to decrease. It can also cause the inverse, which would present a profit on your trade, also called an "arbitrage." The weight of this impact is determined by the size of your trade relative to the size of the liquidity pool.

Conveniently, Uniswap and many other platforms already show this one the UI as it's a critical consideration in a swap trade, but it's still beneficial to understand why/how it works. It can be calculated as follows, using the WETH/USDbC pool as an example:

![Pool Stats](docs/poolstats.png)

We can see that the WETH/USDbC pool currently has a rough valuation (TVL) of $1,520,000, where the reserves are ~203.59 WETH and ~1,030,000 USDC. 

Let's first say that we wanted to swap 200,000 USDbC for WETH. 

We would first calculate the reserve ratio of USDbC/WETH before the swap, which can be calculated as `USDbC_Reserves / WETH_Reserves = reserve_ratio`: 

```
1,030,000 / 203.59 = 5059.19
```

Given this ratio, we can then calculate the constant product, which is the product of the reserves of the pool, and should remain constant after the swap like so `USDbC_reserve_before * WETH_reserve_before = constant_product`:

```
1,030,000 * 203.59 = 209,697,700.0
```

### Price Impact Swapping 200,000 USDbC for WETH

To calculate the price impact of a 200,000 USDbC swap for WETH, given our previous reserve ratio and constant product, we will now need to calculate the reserves after our swap.

We can easily calculate how much USDbC will result in the reserves after the swap, where we add 200,000 to the pool as we are swapping for WETH by using `USDbC_reserve_before + 200000 = USDbC_reserve_after`:

```
1,030,000 + 200,000 = 1,230,000
```

We can then calculate the amount of WETH we will receive from the pool as `constant_product / USDbC_reserve_after = WETH_reserve_after`: 

```
209,697,700 / 1,230,000 = 170.5
```

Lastly, we need to use this value to calculate the reserve ratio after the swap, which can be calculated as `USDbC_Reserves_After / WETH_Reserves_After = reserve_ratio_after`:

```
1,230,000 / 170.5 = 7214.67
```

So at this point we have calculated the following:

- **USDbC Reserves Before**: 1,030,000
- **WETH Reserves Before**: 203.59
- **Reserve Ratio Before**: 5059.19
- **USDbC Reserves After**: 1,230,000
- **WETH Reserves After**: 170.5
- **Reserve Ratio After**: 7214.67

Using this information, we can calculate the price impact of our trade using `(reserve_ratio_after / reserve_ratio_before) - 1 = price_impact`:

```
(1,230,000 / 5059.19) - 1 = 0.426%
```

This value of 0.426% is the price impact of our trade, which is a relatively low impact. This means that our trade will have a relatively low impact on the market price of WETH, and is a good trade to make as we actually gain a higher value in WETH than the USDbC we are swapping for it.
